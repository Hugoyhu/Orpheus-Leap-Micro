# Orpheus-Leap-Micro

For the Summer of 2020, Hack Club has been hosting *Summer of Making*, 3 months of fun, hardware hacking! Partnered with Github, they are giving out $50,000 worth of hardware grants, hosting Show and Tells, and more!

With that said, to further rep and hype up Summer Of Making, I was asked to design a general-purpose Arduino PCB that can be distributed like stickers. This is the Github Repo for the Gerber, Eagle, and documentation for the board.
